A full-stack TypeScript monorepo boilerplate for agentic coding-ready projects, with shared types and a modern Bun, Hono, Vite, React, and React Router file-based routing stack.

## Why bhvr?

While there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much vendor lock-in. bhvr is a boilerplate for building agentic coding-ready projects: clear workspace boundaries, shared TypeScript contracts, predictable client/server structure, and deployment flexibility without sacrificing type safety.

## Features

- **Agentic Coding-Ready Boilerplate**: Predictable structure and conventions that make it easy for coding agents to inspect, modify, and extend the project
- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo with Turbo for build orchestration
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI
  - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) for client-side file-based routing
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build) for monorepo build orchestration and caching

## Project Structure

```
.
├── client/               # React frontend with React Router file-based routing
├── server/               # Hono backend
├── shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
│   └── src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
├── package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
└── turbo.json            # Turbo configuration for build orchestration
```

### Server

bhvr uses Hono as a backend API for its simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. If you have ever used Express then it might feel familiar. Declaring routes and returning data is easy.

```
server
├── bun.lock
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```


If you wanted to add a database to Hono you can do so with a multitude of Typescript libraries like [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or ORMs like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm)

### Client

bhvr uses Vite + React TypeScript with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) for client-side routing. Routes are file-based: add `.tsx` files under `client/src/routes/` and they are automatically registered by `client/src/App.tsx` via `import.meta.glob`. For example, `client/src/routes/index.tsx` maps to `/`, `dashboard.tsx` maps to `/dashboard`, and `[id].tsx` maps to `/:id`.

```
client
├── eslint.config.js
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── vite.svg
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── App.tsx          # Registers file-based routes from src/routes
│   ├── assets
│   ├── components
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── main.tsx
│   ├── routes           # File-based React Router routes
│   │   ├── dashboard.tsx
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   ├── login.tsx
│   │   ├── register.tsx
│   │   └── users.tsx
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── tsconfig.app.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── tsconfig.node.json
└── vite.config.ts
```


### Shared

The Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both environments.

```
shared
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```


By running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared'
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run all workspaces in development mode with Turbo
bun run dev

# Or run individual workspaces directly
bun run dev:client    # Run the Vite dev server for React
bun run dev:server    # Run the Hono backend
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all workspaces with Turbo
bun run build

# Or build individual workspaces directly
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
bun run build:server  # Build the Hono backend
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Lint all workspaces
bun run lint

# Type check all workspaces
bun run type-check

# Run tests across all workspaces
bun run test
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared/types';
```
